# BREDS

BREDS extracts relationships from text using a bootstrapping/semi-supervised approach, it relies on an initial set of 
seed examples, i.e.: pairs of examples of named-entities representing relationship to be extracted. The algorithm 
expands  the initial  set of seed relationships using distributional semantics to generalize the relationship while 
limiting the semantic drift.


### Extracting companies headquarters:

We need the text from where we want to extract relationships with the named-entities tagged, like show in the 
example bellow, an input file `sentences.txt` should contain thousands of sentences with named-entities 
tagged, e.g.:
 
```
The tech company <ORG>Soundcloud</ORG> is based in <LOC>Berlin</LOC>, capital of Germany.
<ORG>Pfizer</ORG> says it has hired <ORG>Morgan Stanley</ORG> to conduct the review.
<ORG>Allianz</ORG>, based in <LOC>Munich</LOC>, said net income rose to EUR 1.32 billion.
<LOC>Switzerland</LOC> and <LOC>South Africa</LOC> are co-chairing the meeting.
<LOC>Ireland</LOC> beat <LOC>Italy</LOC> , then lost 43-31 to <LOC>France</LOC>.
<ORG>Pfizer</ORG>, based in <LOC>New York City</LOC> , employs about 90,000 workers.
<ORG>Botafogo</ORG> leads Group B of the <LOC>Rio de Janeiro</LOC> state championship with six points from two matches.
<PER>Burton</PER> 's engine passed <ORG>NASCAR</ORG> inspection following the qualifying session.
<ORG>Associated Press</ORG> writer <ORG>Gene Johnson</ORG> contributed from <LOC>Seattle</LOC>, <LOC>Washington</LOC>.
...
```

We also need to give example seeds to boostrap the extraction process, specifying the type of each  named-entity and 
examples that should also be present in the `sentences.txt`, snippet shows an example:

```   
e1:ORG
e2:LOC

Nokia;Espoo
Pfizer;New York
Google;Mountain View
Microsoft;Redmond
```   

Save this in a file as `seeds.txt`. BREDS also needs a word embedding model to compute the similarities, you can 
download an already pre-trained model, generated from a subset of the English Gigaword Collection:

```
wget http://data.davidsbatista.net/afp_apw_xin_embeddings.bin
```

You can also download a sentences files from the example above and decompress it:

```
wget http://data.davidsbatista.net/sentences.txt.bz2
bzip -d sentences.txt.bz2
```

Next you can run BREDS with the following command:

```
python runner.py --word2vec=afp_apw_xin_embeddings.bin --sentences=sentences.txt --positive_seeds=seeds.txt --similarity=0.6 --confidence=0.6
```

The parameters `--similarity=0.6` and `--confidence=0.6` are used to control the semantic drift and the confidence 
of the extracted relationships.

Running the whole bootstrap process, depending on your hardware, sentences input size and number of iterations, 
can take from a few minutes to a few hours. 

After the  process is terminated an output file `relationships.jsonl` is generated containing the extracted 
relationships. You can pretty print it's content to the terminal with: `jq '.' < relationships.jsonl`, 

This is an example of `relationships.jsonl` output file:

```
{
  "entity_1": "Medtronic",
  "entity_2": "Minneapolis",
  "confidence": 0.9982486865148862,
  "sentence": "<ORG>Medtronic</ORG> , based in <LOC>Minneapolis</LOC> , is the nation 's largest independent medical device maker . Last month , when it reported revenue of $ 10 billion for the fiscal year , <ORG>Medtronic</ORG> also said that it had set up a business unit to pursue applications of its heart and brain stimulation technology in the obesity market .",
  "bef_words": "",
  "bet_words": ", based in",
  "aft_words": ", is",
  "passive_voice": false
}

{
  "entity_1": "DynCorp",
  "entity_2": "Reston",
  "confidence": 0.9982486865148862,
  "sentence": "Because <ORG>DynCorp</ORG> , headquartered in <LOC>Reston</LOC> , <LOC>Va.</LOC> , gets 98 percent of its revenue from government work .",
  "bef_words": "Because",
  "bet_words": ", headquartered in",
  "aft_words": ", Va.",
  "passive_voice": false
}

{
  "entity_1": "Handspring",
  "entity_2": "Silicon Valley",
  "confidence": 0.893486865148862,
  "sentence": "There will be more firms like <ORG>Handspring</ORG> , a company based in <LOC>Silicon Valley</LOC> that looks as if it is about to become a force in handheld computers , despite its lack of machinery .",
  "bef_words": "firms like",
  "bet_words": ", a company based in",
  "aft_words": "that looks",
  "passive_voice": false
}
```

BREDS contains much more parameters that can be tuned to improve the extraction process, in the example BREDS falls
back to the default values, but these can be set in the configuration file: `parameters.cfg`

    max_tokens_away=6           # maximum number of tokens between the two entities
    min_tokens_away=1           # minimum number of tokens between the two entities
    context_window_size=2       # number of tokens to the left and right of each entity

    alpha=0.2                   # weight of the BEF context in the similarity function
    beta=0.6                    # weight of the BET context in the similarity function
    gamma=0.2                   # weight of the AFT context in the similarity function

    wUpdt=0.5                   # < 0.5 trusts new examples less on each iteration
    number_iterations=4         # number of bootstrap iterations
    wUnk=0.1                    # weight given to unknown extracted relationship instances
    wNeg=2                      # weight given to extracted relationship instances
    min_pattern_support=2       # minimum number of instances in a cluster to be considered a pattern


and then be passed with the argument `--config=parameters.cfg` to the runner script.

In the first step BREDS pre-processes the input file `sentences.txt` generating word vector representations of  
relationships (i.e.: `processed_tuples.pkl`). This is done so that then you can experiment with different seed examples
without having to repeat the process of generating word vectors representations. Just pass the argument 
`--sentences=processed_tuples.pkl` instead to skip this generation step.

## Contributing to BREDS

Improvements, adding new features and bug fixes are more than welcome. If you wish to participate in the development 
of BREDS, please read the following guidelines.

Small fixes and additions can be submitted directly as pull requests, but larger changes should be discussed in 
an issue first.

### The contribution process at a glance

1. Preparing the development environment
2. Code away!
3. Continuous Integration
4. Submit your changes by opening a pull request

You can expect a reply within a few days, but please be patient if it takes a bit longer.

### Preparing the development environment

```sh
git clone git@github.com:davidsbatista/BREDS.git
cd BREDS
python3.9 -m virtualenv venv  # make sure you have python 3.9 installed
source venv/bin/activate      # install BREDS in edit mode and with development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```


### Continuous Integration

BREDS runs a continuous integration (CI) on all pull requests. This means that if you open a pull request (PR), a full 
test suite is run on your PR: 

- The code is formatted using `black` and `isort` 
- Unused imports are auto-removed using `pycln`
- Linting is done using `pyling` and `flake8`
- Type checking is done using `mypy`
- Tests are run using `pytest`

This frees you up to ignore all local setup on your side, focus on the code and rely on the CI to fix everything and 
point you to the places that need fixing. Nevertheless, if you prefer to run the tests & formatting locally, it's 
possible too. 

```sh
make all
```

### Opening a Pull Request

Every PR should be accompanied by short description of the changes, including:
- Impact and  motivation for the changes
- Any open issues that are closed by this PR
